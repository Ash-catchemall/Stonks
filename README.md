Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This Python script utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. The script loads a dataset containing historical stock prices, preprocesses the data, trains an LSTM model, evaluates its performance, and makes predictions for future stock prices.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
keras
matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn keras matplotlib

Usage
Replace 'dataset.csv' with your actual dataset file containing historical stock prices.
Adjust hyperparameters as needed, such as sequence_length, epochs, batch_size, num_lstm_layers, lstm_units, and dropout_rate, to optimize the model's performance for your dataset.

Run the script using Python:
python stock_price_prediction.py

This script was developed by [Ash-catchemall] as part of a project on stock price prediction.
